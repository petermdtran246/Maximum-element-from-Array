# Maximum element from Array
This is a simple C++ program that finds the maximum number in an array of integers.

## Algorithm
  -  The program defines a function Max() that initializes an array A with 10 elements and finds the maximum number using a for loop. The maximum number is then printed to the console using cout.
  -  Note: The main() function calls the non-existing function Sum(), it should be changed to Max().
